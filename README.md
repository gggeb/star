# star

star is a bullet-hell/platformer game that explores philosophy, the nature of
consciousness and man's place in an increasily disenfranchised world.

it consists of two major gameplay segments, ship-bound star-fighter sequences
and 2D platforming sequences where the player controls a rolling robotic ball.

the player character is a robot bountyhunter who struggles to grasp their
purpose in an uncaring world. the robots sentience is caused by its BPU
(Biological Processing Unit) and is restrained by its programming.

the player has the choice between gameplay styles: a cybernetic focused style,
and a PSI-power based style (similar to system shock). the cybernetic
play-style is progressed through obedient behaviour and good work-ethic while
the PSI-power play-style is progressed through rebellious behaviour and
uniqueness. the PSI-power style ultimately leads to a better ending, but both
play-styles are mechanically viable and a cybernetic focused playthrough is
easier initially.

## technical details

i will implement star as a browser game with the goal of it being playable on
both desktop and mobile platforms, with a stretch goal of having an electron
style implementation available on mobile app stores.

## art direction

i'm going to use vector-based art style with a focus on colour and form, rather
than detail.
